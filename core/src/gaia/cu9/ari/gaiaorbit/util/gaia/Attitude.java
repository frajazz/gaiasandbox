 * rotation at that moment.

 * Getters exists to provide the attitude and inertial rotation in various
 * forms, including a quaternion ({@link #getQuaternion()}, a set of heliotropic
 * or equatorial angles ({@link #getHeliotropicAnglesRates() and @link
 * #getEquatorialAnglesRates()} plus corresponding time derivatives. There are
 * also methods to obtain a number of attitude-related quantities, e.g., the
 * celestial pointings of two FOVs and the AL and AC rates for a particular
 * point in the FoV.
